//If you know a solution is not far from the root
// BFS

//If the tre is very deep and solutions are rare:
//BFS (DFS is will take long)

//If the tree is very wide
//DFS (BFS is need too much memeory)

//If solutions are frequent but located deep
// DFS

//Determing if a path exist
// DFS

// Finding shortest path
// BFS
